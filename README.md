Thanks to...

The Vine team for making such an awesome app, and the authors of [Giraffe](https://github.com/unixpickle/Giraffe) and [Hpple](https://github.com/topfunky/hpple) for having such awesome open source libraries.

A note
========
This is my second-ever Mac app and I'm sure I did everything wrong as far as project structure. I'd appreciate any feedback for future projects!
